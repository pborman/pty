# pty

pty is a ```screen``` like program for managing sessions on a remote machine.  It uses ```<ctrl-p>``` as the escape character. ```<ctrl-p>.``` is used to disconnect.  Use ```<ctrl-p>:``` to execute a pty command.  Use <ctrl-p>:help for a list of commands.
  
I wrote it mainly for personal use.  Github is a convient way to import it on my corporate appliance.
