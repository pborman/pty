You should be using github.com/pborman/ansi and not this package.

This package should not be needed.  Instead, github.com/pborman/ansi should be
used.  However, this version of the package seems to be newer than
github.com/pborman/ansi.  Unfortunately there are conflicts between the two
packages.

The Strip function has been renamed Strip1.  The new Strip function is Unicode
safe and will not strip unicode characters.

The new package does not contain the Decode function.  You are expected to use
the Reader.

The S structures are not the same.

The old S structure is:
	type S struct {
		Code   Name     // The escape sequences sans parameters
		Type   string   // The type of escape sequence
		Params []string // parameters
	}
The new S structure is:
	type S struct {
		Type   string   // The type of sequence
		Text   string   // The actual text of the sequence
		Code   Name     // The escape sequence sans parameters (empty for text)
		Params []string // parameters
		Error  error    // Any encoutered error while processing the sequence
	}

In the old S structure Code would contain plain text if Type was "".  In the new
structure Text contains the raw text while Code only contains a canonicalized
version of the escapce sequence, if any.
