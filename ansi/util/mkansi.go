Notation: (Pn) Representation: CSI Pn 05/10
Parameter default value: Pn = 1
CBT causes the active presentation position to be moved to the character position corresponding to the n-th preceding character tabulation stop in the presentation component, according to the character path, where n equals the value of Pn.
8.3.8 CCH - CANCEL CHARACTER
Notation: (C1)
Representation: 09/04 or ESC 05/04
CCH is used to indicate that both the preceding graphic character in the data stream, (represented by one or more bit combinations) including SPACE, and the control function CCH itself are to be ignored for further interpretation of the data stream.
If the character preceding CCH in the data stream is a control function (represented by one or more bit combinations), the effect of CCH is not defined by this Standard.
8.3.9 CHA - CURSOR CHARACTER ABSOLUTE

The effect of CR depends on the setting of the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) and on the parameter value of SELECT IMPLICIT MOVEMENT DIRECTION (SIMD).
If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to PRESENTATION and with the parameter value of SIMD equal to 0, CR causes the active presentation position to be moved to the line home position of the same line in the presentation component. The line home position is established by the parameter value of SET LINE HOME (SLH).
With a parameter value of SIMD equal to 1, CR causes the active presentation position to be moved to the line limit position of the same line in the presentation component. The line limit position is established by the parameter value of SET LINE LIMIT (SLL).
If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to DATA and with a parameter value of SIMD equal to 0, CR causes the active data position to be moved to the line home position of the same line in the data component. The line home position is established by the parameter value of SET LINE HOME (SLH).

CTC causes one or more tabulation stops to be set or cleared in the presentation component, depending on the parameter values:
0 a character tabulation stop is set at the active presentation position
1 a line tabulation stop is set at the active line (the line that contains the active presentation position)
2 the character tabulation stop at the active presentation position is cleared
3 the line tabulation stop at the active line is cleared
4 all character tabulation stops in the active line are cleared
5 all character tabulation stops are cleared
6 all line tabulation stops are cleared
In the case of parameter values 0, 2 or 4 the number of lines affected depends on the setting of the TABULATION STOP MODE (TSM).
8.3.18 CUB - CURSOR LEFT
Notation: (Pn) Representation: CSI Pn 04/04
Parameter default value: Pn = 1
CUB causes the active presentation position to be moved leftwards in the presentation component by n character positions if the character path is horizontal, or by n line positions if the character path is vertical, where n equals the value of Pn.
8.3.19 CUD - CURSOR DOWN
Notation: (Pn) Representation: CSI Pn 04/02
Parameter default value: Pn = 1
CUD causes the active presentation position to be moved downwards in the presentation component by n line positions if the character path is horizontal, or by n character positions if the character path is vertical, where n equals the value of Pn.
8.3.20 CUF - CURSOR RIGHT
Notation: (Pn) Representation: CSI Pn 04/03
Parameter default value: Pn = 1
CUF causes the active presentation position to be moved rightwards in the presentation component by n character positions if the character path is horizontal, or by n line positions if the character path is vertical, where n equals the value of Pn.
8.3.21 CUP - CURSOR POSITION
Notation: (Pn1;Pn2) Representation: CSI Pn1;Pn2 04/08
Parameter default values: Pn1 = 1; Pn2 = 1
CUP causes the active presentation position to be moved in the presentation component to the n-th line position according to the line progression and to the m-th character position according to the character path, where n equals the value of Pn1 and m equals the value of Pn2.
8.3.22 CUU - CURSOR UP
Notation: (Pn) Representation: CSI Pn 04/01
Parameter default value: Pn = 1
CUU causes the active presentation position to be moved upwards in the presentation component by n line positions if the character path is horizontal, or by n character positions if the character path is vertical, where n equals the value of Pn.
8.3.23 CVT - CURSOR LINE TABULATION
Notation: (Pn) Representation: CSI Pn 05/09
Parameter default value: Pn = 1
CVT causes the active presentation position to be moved to the corresponding character position of the line corresponding to the n-th following line tabulation stop in the presentation component, where n equals the value of Pn.
8.3.24 DA - DEVICE ATTRIBUTES
Notation: (Ps) Representation: CSI Ps 06/03
Parameter default value: Ps = 0
With a parameter value not equal to 0, DA is used to identify the device which sends the DA. The parameter value is a device type identification code according to a register which is to be established. If the parameter value is 0, DA is used to request an identifying DA from a device.
8.3.25 DAQ - DEFINE AREA QUALIFICATION
Notation: (Ps...) Representation: CSI Ps... 06/15
Parameter default value: Ps = 0
DAQ is used to indicate that the active presentation position in the presentation component is the first character position of a qualified area. The last character position of the qualified area is the character position in the presentation component immediately preceding the first character position of the following qualified area.
The parameter value designates the type of qualified area:
0 unprotected and unguarded
1 protected and guarded
2 graphic character input
3 numeric input
4 alphabetic input
5 input aligned on the last character position of the qualified area
6 fill with ZEROs
7 set a character tabulation stop at the active presentation position (the first character position of the qualified area) to indicate the beginning of a field
8 protected and unguarded
9 fill with SPACEs
10 input aligned on the first character position of the qualified area
11 the order of the character positions in the input field is reversed, i.e. the last position in each line becomes the first and vice versa; input begins at the new first position.
This control function operates independently of the setting of the TABULATION STOP MODE (TSM). The character tabulation stop set by parameter value 7 applies to the active line only.
NOTE
The control functions for area definition (DAQ, EPA, ESA, SPA, SSA) should not be used within an SRS string or an SDS string.
8.3.26 DCH - DELETE CHARACTER
Notation: (Pn) Representation: CSI Pn 05/00
Parameter default value: Pn = 1
If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to PRESENTATION, DCH causes the contents of the active presentation position and, depending on the setting of the CHARACTER EDITING MODE (HEM), the contents of the n-1 preceding or following character positions to be removed from the presentation component, where n equals the value of Pn. The resulting gap is closed by shifting the contents of the adjacent character positions towards the active presentation position. At the other end of the shifted part, n character positions are put into the erased state.
The extent of the shifted part is established by SELECT EDITING EXTENT (SEE).
The effect of DCH on the start or end of a selected area, the start or end of a qualified area, or a tabulation stop in the shifted part is not defined by this Standard.
If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to DATA, DCH causes the contents of the active data position and, depending on the setting of the CHARACTER EDITING MODE (HEM), the contents of the n-1 preceding or following character positions to be removed from the data component, where n equals the value of Pn. The resulting gap is closed by shifting the contents of the adjacent character positions towards the active data position. At the other end of the shifted part, n character positions are put into the erased state.
8.3.27 DCS - DEVICE CONTROL STRING
Notation: (C1)
Representation: 09/00 or ESC 05/00
DCS is used as the opening delimiter of a control string for device control use. The command string following may consist of bit combinations in the range 00/08 to 00/13 and 02/00 to 07/14. The control string is closed by the terminating delimiter STRING TERMINATOR (ST).
The command string represents either one or more commands for the receiving device, or one or more status reports from the sending device. The purpose and the format of the command string are specified by the most recent occurrence of IDENTIFY DEVICE CONTROL STRING (IDCS), if any, or depend on the sending and/or the receiving device.
8.3.28 DC1 - DEVICE CONTROL ONE

8.3.86 NEL - NEXT LINE
Notation: (C1)
Representation: 08/05 or ESC 04/05
The effect of NEL depends on the setting of the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) and on the parameter value of SELECT IMPLICIT MOVEMENT DIRECTION (SIMD).
If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to PRESENTATION and with a parameter value of SIMD equal to 0, NEL causes the active presentation position to be moved to the line home position of the following line in the presentation component. The line home position is established by the parameter value of SET LINE HOME (SLH).
With a parameter value of SIMD equal to 1, NEL causes the active presentation position to be moved to the line limit position of the following line in the presentation component. The line limit position is established by the parameter value of SET LINE LIMIT (SLL).
If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to DATA and with a parameter value of SIMD equal to 0, NEL causes the active data position to be moved to the line home position of the following line in the data component. The line home position is established by the parameter value of SET LINE HOME (SLH).
With a parameter value of SIMD equal to 1, NEL causes the active data position to be moved to the line limit position of the following line in the data component. The line limit position is established by the parameter value of SET LINE LIMIT (SLL).

Notation: (C1)
Representation: 08/11 or ESC 04/11
PLD causes the active presentation position to be moved in the presentation component to the corresponding position of an imaginary line with a partial offset in the direction of the line progression. This offset should be sufficient either to image following characters as subscripts until the first following occurrence of PARTIAL LINE BACKWARD (PLU) in the data stream, or, if preceding characters were imaged as superscripts, to restore imaging of following characters to the active line (the line that contains the active presentation position).
Any interactions between PLD and format effectors other than PLU are not defined by this Standard.

The parameter values are
0 end of parallel texts
1 beginning of a string of principal parallel text
2 beginning of a string of supplementary parallel text
3 beginning of a string of supplementary Japanese phonetic annotation
4 beginning of a string of supplementary Chinese phonetic annotation
5 end of a string of supplementary phonetic annotations
PTX with a parameter value of 1 indicates the beginning of the string of principal text intended to be presented in parallel with one or more strings of supplementary text.
PTX with a parameter value of 2, 3 or 4 indicates the beginning of a string of supplementary text that is intended to be presented in parallel with either a string of principal text or the immediately preceding string of supplementary text, if any; at the same time it indicates the end of the preceding string of principal text or of the immediately preceding string of supplementary text, if any. The end of a string of supplementary text is indicated by a subsequent occurrence of PTX with a parameter value other than 1.
PTX with a parameter value of 0 indicates the end of the strings of text intended to be presented in parallel with one another.
NOTE
PTX does not explicitly specify the relative placement of the strings of principal and supplementary parallel texts, or the relative sizes of graphic characters in the strings of parallel text. A string of supplementary text is normally presented in a line adjacent to the line containing the string of principal text, or adjacent to the line containing the immediately preceding string of supplementary text, if any. The first graphic character of the string of principal text and the first graphic character of a string of supplementary text are normally presented in the same position of their respective lines. However, a string of supplementary text longer (when presented) than the associated string of principal text may be centred on that string. In the case of long strings of text, such as paragraphs in different languages, the strings may be presented in successive lines in parallel columns, with their beginnings aligned with one another and the shorter of the paragraphs followed by an appropriate amount of "white space".
Japanese phonetic annotation typically consists of a few half-size or smaller Kana characters which indicate the pronunciation or interpretation of one or more Kanji characters and are presented above those Kanji characters if the character path is horizontal, or to the right of them if the character path is vertical.
Chinese phonetic annotation typically consists of a few Pinyin characters which indicate the pronunciation of one or more Hanzi characters and are presented above those Hanzi characters. Alternatively, the Pinyin characters may be presented in the same line as the Hanzi characters and following the respective Hanzi characters. The Pinyin characters will then be presented within enclosing pairs of parentheses.

This direction may be different from that currently established. The indicated string follows the preceding text. The established character progression is not affected.
The beginning of a directed string is indicated by SDS with a parameter value not equal to 0. A directed string may contain one or more nested strings. These nested strings may be directed strings the beginnings of which are indicated by SDS with a parameter value not equal to 0, or reversed strings the beginnings of which are indicated by START REVERSED STRING (SRS) with a parameter value of 1. Every beginning of such a string invokes the next deeper level of nesting.
This Standard does not define the location of the active data position within any such nested string.
The end of a directed string is indicated by SDS with a parameter value of 0. Every end of such a string re-establishes the next higher level of nesting (the one in effect prior to the string just ended). The direction is re-established to that in effect prior to the string just ended. The active data position is moved to the character position following the characters of the string just ended.
The parameter values are:
0 end of a directed string; re-establish the previous direction
1 start of a directed string; establish the direction left-to-right
